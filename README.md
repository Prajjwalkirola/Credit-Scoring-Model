OVERVIEW:
This project implements a credit scoring model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on various features such as income, credit history, and demographic information.

FEATURES:
Data preprocessing: Clean and transform raw data.
Feature engineering: Extract relevant features.
Model selection: Choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
Model training: Train the selected model on historical data.
Model evaluation: Assess model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Deployment: Deploy the model for real-world use.
